 * Poor man's parallelization engine, but good enough for our needs
 * (parallelizing rather large chunks of work).
 * 
 * Works well when used with a ThreadPoolExecutor.
 * 
 * ForkJoinPool can also be used, but it might make things slower,
 * since it's not optimized for latency but for throughput,
 * especially when used from a non-worker thread,
 * whereas ThreadPoolExecutor is good at spinning up just the needed amount
 * of workers fast (using chain signaling) and then getting them back to rest
